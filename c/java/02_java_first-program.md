Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Java, along with an explanation of its key components and how to run it. 

The Program:
The program must be saved in a file named exactly HelloWorld.java. 

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}


*** - class name must match file name
- main() is the entry point ***

*** we will learn  about each of the term in the above code going ahead.***
