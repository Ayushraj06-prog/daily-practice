What is Java?
Ans: JAVA is a popular, high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform known for its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability, allowing code to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), it's used to build everything from mobile apps (Android), web apps, and enterprise software to scientific applications, leveraging principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Key Characteristics
Object-Oriented (OOP): Organizes code around objects and classes, making it modular and reusable, similar to C++ but simpler.
Platform-Independent: Compiled into bytecode that runs on any JVM, ensuring portability across Windows, macOS, Linux, etc..
Versatile: Powers a vast range of applications, from large enterprise systems to small devices.
Secure & Robust: Features automatic memory management (garbage collection) and strong security, reducing common programming errors. 

Key Reasons for Choosing Java:
Platform Independence (WORA): Runs on any device with a JVM, not tied to one OS.
Enterprise Strength: Trusted by big companies for secure, scalable banking, insurance, and government systems.
Object-Oriented: Promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code through objects.
Robust & Secure: Features strong memory management, exception handling, and security APIs, protecting data.
Rich Ecosystem: Extensive standard libraries, APIs, and powerful frameworks (Spring, EE) speed up development.
Versatility: Powers Android apps, web apps, big data, AI, and embedded systems.
High Demand: Strong job market due to its widespread use and relevance in cloud-native development.
Future-Proof: Continually evolving with features like Virtual Threads (Project Loom) for massive concurrency. 


JDK (Java Development Kit): It  is a complete software development kit for Java, used by developers to write, compile, and debug applications. 
It is a superset of the JRE and includes development tools like the compiler (javac) and debugger. 

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): It is a software package that provides the libraries and the JVM required to run Java applications.
It is intended for end-users who only need to execute Java programs, not develop them, and it does not contain development tools like compilers. 

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): It is an abstract machine and the core execution engine that runs the Java bytecode (compiled .class files).
It is responsible for converting bytecode into machine-specific code, making Java platform-independent ("write once, run anywhere"), 
though the JVM implementation itself is platform-dependent (each OS needs its own JVM). 


Steps of how a java program is executed in a system:
1.source code (compiled to)---->2.bytecode(interpreted to)------>3.machine code.
